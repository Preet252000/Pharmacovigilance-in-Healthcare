1.Situation: We were asked to build a dashboard for this course of data visualization for the concept of Pharmacovigilance.

2.Task:  Major responsibility was to choose 2 drugs from 3 of top pharma companies, find their data of adverse events and analyze the results.

3.Action:  We chose Injectable Insulin and oral insulin as our choice of drugs from Eli lily, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer as the primary top 3 companies. Using Open FDA we found data from 1985 till 2023 for these drugs. Performed an exploratory data analysis for 10,000 rows of data where we selected our variables (mode of administration, age, sex, year, adverse event, effect on life, level of severity, reporting organization). On tableau desktop we made an interactive dashboard which represented the prevalence of disease as per the countries and states, number of adverse events and which company reported the highest number of reactions. 

4.Results: Injectable human insulin had the highest number of cases (597) in males from 2000 till date, followed by Insulin Asparte and Glucotrol. Visual Impairment, Hyperglycemia and drug ineffectiveness were the top 3 adverse reactions reported highest by Eli Lily and Novo Nordisk.
